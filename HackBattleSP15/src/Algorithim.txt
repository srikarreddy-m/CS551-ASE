Approach for Programming the Map Reduce logic using Java:

There are 2 set of Map Reduce Programs developed for performing statistical analysis

Set 1 : This set of map-reduce program is used to compute intermediate statistical results.

	Mapper Class : ReadInputMapper
				
				Input(Key,Values): Source file path as Key ,Set of integer data set separated by new line as Values
				Output(Key,Values): A common identifier assigned to each of the integer as key, Individual integer data as Values

	Reducer Class :IntermediateReducer
				
				Input(Key,Values): A common identifier assigned to each of the integer from map as key, Individual iterable integer data as Values
				Output(Key,Values): An identifier assigned by mapper to each of the integer as key, 
									Computation result i.e count,sum,min,max and sum of individual squares of data as Values
	

Set 2 : This set of map-reduce program takes the intermediate results generated from from set 1
		and performs aggregation of intermediate reducer outputs to compute complete statistical analysis on entire data set.

	Mapper Class : ComputationMapper
				
				Input(Key,Values): Merged file path containing results from Jobs executed from set 1 map-reduce programs as Key,
									Merged result set as Values
									 
				Output(Key,Values): An identifier assigned to represent Set 2 Mapper as key, 
									Temporary results of required statistics - calculated count,sum,mean,min,max,standard deviation(except percentiles) as Values

	Reducer Class :ComputationReducer
	
				Input(Key,Values):  An identifier assigned by Set 2 Mapper as key, 
									Temporary results of required statistics from mapper- calculated count,sum,mean,min,max,standard deviation(except percentiles) as Values

									 
				Output(Key,Values): An identifier assigned to represent final computation as key, 
									Complete statistical analysis results on Entire dataset from multiple sources as Values
									
In order to accommodate large data set from multiple systems we can create multiple jobs in the driver class to create intermediate values 
for each of the integer data set.To generate intermediate key values pair we make use of set 1 map reduce program.

For now we have implemented two map-reduce jobs and each job takes individual input file containing integer dataset from different source path.
Finally, a third map-reduce job is invoked to merge the output from above two jobs and compute the complete statistical analysis discussed in problem statement on the entire dataset.

Job 1: This job uses set 1 map-reduce tasks to generate intermediate data for one source file.

Job 2: This job also uses set 1 ma-reduce tasks to generate intermediate data based on another source file.

Job 3: It first merges the reducer output values of job 1 & job 2 and later, it computes the required statistical analysis on entire dataset.
